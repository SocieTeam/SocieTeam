# SocieTeam
## Press Release

“For a democratic world where we must hold ourselves, elected officials, and public servants accountable, SocieTeam provides a platform for people to schedule, meet and organize around a central issue or problem that unites them. Together, users may vent their frustrations and discuss solutions to the ills of their community in a shared space, be it virtual or in the flesh.”

### Who Do We Serve?
We aim to serve the underserved, the underrepresented, and the misrepresented; Our clients are all who seek change in their communities.

### Product Overview
SocieTeam is a community-based application that allows registered users to create events, be they virtual or in person, where other registered users can view and RSVP to attend these events. The context of these events is to unite to discuss some issue within the community with the ultimate goal of reaching some solution. SocieTeam gives users a space in which they can direct their energies and emotions into positive change.

### The Problem

On the internet there really aren't many local forums or chats in which people can talk about their experiences without having to make a ‘group’ on some other applications. The people who have this problem may be the ones who want to talk about a topic/experience but feel like there’s too little talk since there is no group. Additionally, most internet forums discuss issues at the global or national level, and while such conversation is important, it alone is hardly enough to make changes at those levels. By designing our app with a local focus, it is our hope that small changes accumulate over time into larger movements.

### Our Solution

SocieTeam helps people connect and have them talk about the issues they have in their communities. It lets them meet and discuss issues either virtually or in person. Users may also search for and filter out and discover events based on a specific issue that they may be passionate about to be able to make a change.

### Key Technical Challenges

The initial scaffolding of the project to set up routes, database endpoints, and all the views will be a formidable challenge, in addition to employing the use of Google API’s for in-person events. Also, using React while having rather limited knowledge of best practices and patterns will pose a challenge for the client-facing side of the project.
